 abstract = {A simplified model is presented for the sequence of events occurring during human reproduction. Like the more general system (Perrin and Sheps, 1964) of which this is a special case, the model provides for fetal wastage and for nonsusceptible periods associated with pregnancy that vary with the outcome of pregnancy. If it is assumed that these periods are of constant duration for each outcome, closed expressions are available for the probability distribution of births in a period of y years after marriage. Numerical values may be obtained from tables of the binomial or Poisson distributions or from a computer program. The model yields generating functions for intervals between births and from marriage until the r-th birth. It is easily extended to provide for complete sterility in part of the population, and (under suitable assumptions) for a distribution of fecundabilities in the population.},
